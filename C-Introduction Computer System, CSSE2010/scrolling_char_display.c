/*
 * scrolling_char_display.c
 *
 * Original version by Peter Sutton. Modified by <Martin Yu>
 *
 * This is an example of how the LED display board can be used. 
 * This program scrolls a message from right to left on the
 * board. The font used is defined below and is 7 dots high and
 * varies between 3 and 5 dots wide, depending on the character.
 * Letters and numbers can be handled (though lower case
 * letters are displayed as upper case). All other characters
 * display as a blank column.
 * 
 * The program also demonstrates how data can be stored in the
 * program (flash) memory, without also taking up space in RAM.
 * If the arrays below were defined in the normal C way, they
 * would take up space in both the program memory (where the
 * constants would be stored) and the RAM (where the values 
 * would be copied on start-up). The use of the PROGMEM attribute
 * and functions/macros like pgm_read_byte() means that the
 * constants can live just in the program memory and not be 
 * copied to RAM. (This saves several hundred bytes of RAM.)

/* FONT DEFINITION
 *
 * The following define the columns of data to be displayed
 * for each character (a-z and 0-9). The most significant
 * 7 bits (bit 7 to bit 1) represent the data for rows 0 to 6 
 * (top to bottom). The least significant bit is 1 only for
 * the last column of letter data. (This is how the software
 * will know when it has reached the last column for this 
 * character. For example, the data for
 * the 4 columns of letter A is as follows:
 * bit 7   * 
 * bit 6 *  *
 * bit 5 *  *
 * bit 4 ****
 * bit 3 *  *
 * bit 2 *  *
 * bit 1 *  *
 * bit 0    *
